## Missing Number Lab
The missing number function accepts two arrays as arguments.
The arrays are compared and if both are null or both have the same numbers, it returns 0
If one array is longer than the other, then the extra number in the longer array is returned.
E.g 
```
Array 1 : [91, 6, 45, 11]
Array 2 : [6, 11, 91]
```
The function will return *45*
